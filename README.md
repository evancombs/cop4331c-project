# cop4331c-project
Group project for COP4331C, Ecosystem simulation in Unity
## Group members:
*  Evan Combs
*  William Cross
*  Parker Doughty
*  Patrick Caughey
*  Nathan Manierre

## Project Vision
  Our project is to create a simulation of an ecosystem. Our project is primarily research based and intended to explore the more complex interactions and emergent behavior of a larger system consisting of simple rules. To build our project, we will use the Unity game engine with scripting in C#. This project has applications in modelling real world systems, and can be adapted to specific situations to more accurately model them over a general system.
